Lets say minimum support count is 3 ---> 60%
Relation hold is maximal frequent => closed => frequent
1-frequent:
{A} = 3; // not closed due to {A, C} and not maximal
{B} = 4; // not closed due to {B, D} and no maximal
{C} = 4; // not closed due to {C, D} not maximal
{D} = 5; // closed item-set since not immediate super-set has same count. Not maximal

2-frequent:
{A, B} = 2 // not frequent because support count < minimum support count so ignore
{A, C} = 3 // not closed due to {A, C, D}
{A, D} = 3 // not closed due to {A, C, D}
{B, C} = 3 // not closed due to {B, C, D}
{B, D} = 4 // closed but not maximal due to {B, C, D}
{C, D} = 4 // closed but not maximal due to {B, C, D}

3-frequent:
{A, B, C} = 2 // ignore not frequent because support count < minimum support count
{A, B, D} = 2 // ignore not frequent because support count < minimum support count
{A, C, D} = 3 // maximal frequent
{B, C, D} = 3 // maximal frequent

4-frequent:
{A, B, C, D} = 2 //ignore not frequent
